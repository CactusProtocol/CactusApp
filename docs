# ⚙️ Development Guide for CactusProtocol

This guide provides instructions for setting up your development environment and interacting with the CactUScript compiler and the Solana programs.

## I. Environment Setup

### A. Compiler Dependencies
1.  **Install Rust:** Follow the official instructions for your operating system.
2.  **Install Solana CLI:** This is required for deploying and interacting with programs.
    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -sSfL [https://install.solana.com/beta](https://install.solana.com/beta))"
    ```
3.  **Install Anchor:** If you plan to extend the compiler with Anchor features.
    ```bash
    # Assuming you have Rust's Cargo installed
    cargo install --git [https://github.com/project-serum/anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) anchor-cli --tag v0.28.0
    ```

## II. Compiling CactUScript

The compiler lives in the `cactuScript/compiler` directory.

1.  **Build the Compiler:**
    ```bash
    cd cactuScript/compiler
    cargo build --release
    # The executable 'cactusc' is now in target/release/
    ```

2.  **Compile the Router Program:**
    Use the compiled executable to generate the BPF bytecode (`.so` file).
    ```bash
    # Run from the root directory
    ./cactuScript/compiler/target/release/cactusc compile ./programs/CactusSwapRouter/src/main.cactus
    # Output: programs/CactusSwapRouter/target/CactusSwapRouter.so
    ```

## III. Testing the Router

Integration tests are located in the `tests/` directory and typically run using TypeScript/Jest. You must have a local Solana validator running.

```bash
# Start a local validator (in a separate terminal)
solana-test-validator 

# Run the tests
npm install # if not already done
npm test tests/router.test.ts
